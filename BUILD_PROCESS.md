# How I Started

I started by creating a simple Flask application that could serve a single HTML page. I then added a basic chatbot interface that could respond to user messages. I also added a database to store user messages and chatbot responses. Finally, I added a simple scoring engine that could compute financial metrics from a cleaned historical price DataFrame.

# How Your Thinking Evolved

I also added a database to store user messages and chatbot responses. Finally, I added a simple scoring engine that could compute financial metrics from a cleaned historical price DataFrame.

# Alternative Approaches Considered

I considered using a more complex chatbot framework like Rasa, but decided against it because it would add unnecessary complexity to the project. I also considered using a more complex scoring engine, but decided against it because it would add unnecessary complexity to the project.

# Refactoring Decisions

I decided to refactor the code to use a more object-oriented approach. I also decided to add a database to store user messages and chatbot responses. Finally, I decided to add a simple scoring engine that could compute financial metrics from a cleaned historical price DataFrame.

# Mistakes And Corrections 

I made a mistake by not adding a database to store user messages and chatbot responses. I corrected this by adding a database to store user messages and chatbot responses.
